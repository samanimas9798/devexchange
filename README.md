A web application that connects users who want to share and learn new tech skills. 
The web application supports both mutual exchanges (users can teach what they know, and learn from others) and non-mutual exchanges (users can just teach or just learn).

This project was built using Java, Spring Boot, HTML/CSS/JavaScript, and Maria DB.

Features of the app:
- User registration & login  
- Profile with username, email, and skills to teach/learn  
- Connection requests between users  
- Question forum (like Stack Overflow)
